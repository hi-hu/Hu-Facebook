#### Requirements
Static photo tiles on the initial screen
* [x] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
* [x] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
* [x] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
* [x] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
* [x] Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable. <--- this is super buggy due to scrollview paging
* [x] Optional: The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.
